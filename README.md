<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Webpage homepage](https://github.com/shubh4mk/Cab-Management-Project/blob/main/readMeImages/1Homepage.png)
Thanks for landing here, This is our project based on  carpool. We aim to connect Lavasa and Pune for students studying at Christ University Lavasa campus. This project aims to find pocket-friendly rides for students based on their requirements and at the same time also profitable to drivers and car owners.

Here's why:
* Available cars in Lavasa charge a huge fair ðŸ’¸ amount from students.
* Students can enter the amount they can afford.
* Skilled drivers
